# go-http-server

A basic HTTP server implemented in Go (Golang).
It focuses on demonstrating how to create an HTTP server from scratch using Go’s standard libraries without relying on external dependencies.

Key components of the project:

- Main functionality: Implements a server that listens for HTTP requests and sends appropriate responses.
- Router: Basic routing mechanism for different endpoints.
- Concurrency: Uses Go’s goroutines to handle multiple connections.

The project is ideal for learning and understanding the internals of a web server in Go.
